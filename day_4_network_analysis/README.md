# Day 4 -- SICSS Networks Workshop

In this repositorsy, you will find all the materials as well as the datasets we will work with during the networks workshop. 
The materials exists in R and Python so that you can choose the language you would like to work with. 

The exercise sheets are labeled Network_Analysis_day_in_{R,Python}.{R, ipynb} and the files containing the solutions Network_Analysis_day_in_{R,Python}_solutions.{R, ipynb}. 
The data is stored in the ./data folder. 

The workshop is broadly structured into two parts: Fist, you get an introduction on how to represent networks in R or Python, and how to perform analyes on your network data. 
The second part contains some exercises that are desinged to stimulate your network thinking. 

Part 1: 
- Represent an network in R or Python 
  - Create a graph from scratch (add nodes, edges, attributes)
  - Visualise it
- Basic network descriptives
  - macro level descriptives
  - meso level descriptives
